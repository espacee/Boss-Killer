The source code is located in the src/ directory.

The documentation can be generated with Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).
By default, the documentation is generated into the doc/ subdirectory

Conventions for C++ source code:

File naming:
- File names are CamelCase if they define classes, lowercase otherwise
- Header files have the extension .hpp
- Source files have the extension .cpp

Symbol naming:
- Variables are camelCase
- Function names are camelCase()
- Class names are CamelCase
- Macro names are UPPER_CASE
- Compile time constants (e.g. constexpr) are UPPER_CASE
- Private class and namespace member variables are prefixed with m_

Formatting:
- Indentation is 4 spaces

- Pad operators with spaces
  Example: "foo += 4" instead of "foo+=4"

- Insert a space after between if/for/while/etc. and the opening paren
  Example: "if (condition == true)" instead of "if(condition == true)"

- Pointers and references are aligned to the name
  Example: MyType *myObject; MyType &myReference;

You don't have to worry too much about the formatting, as the source code
is periodically formatted with Artistic Style (http://astyle.sourceforge.net/).
